<!-- I have used javascript (jquery ui-widgets) to create an accordian widget - http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ 
I understand that by placing my h3 and p tags within a div lablled with an id called accordian, will allow them to access "accordian" properties. Because I link this page with the jquery ui library, it is able to create this widget. In addition, I have learnt that even if some browsers have not got javascript enabled, they can still view information I am displaying on my wensite.

        <h3>Occupation</h3>
        <div class="restp">
        <p>My grandfather worked as farmer before he came to England. This was his full time job. It involved him having to work alongside others, to sew seeds, and collect harvest. He also had to tend to the cows and make sure all animals on the farm were cared for.</p>

        <p>My grandmother worked as housewife. Her day to day life included basic household chores, such as cooking and cleaning. Not to mention looking after 7 children! </p>   
        </div>

<!--    Third heading and paragraphs-->
        <h3>Coming to England</h3>
        <div class="restp">
        <p>When the second world war was over my grandfather had the oportunity to come to England and start working. He lived in Ponders End, Enfield, London, England. At the beginning he came alone, leaving his family, and began working in factories. He carried out basic tasks such as picking and packing different items. As time went on, he got permission to bring his wife over, then his children. Around this time his oldest son stayed behind in order to look after the family home, while everyone else moved to England.
        </p>

        <p>  
        My second and third oldest uncles started education however, were unable to finish, as they needed to work full time to support the family. This allowed the remaining children to start education.
        </p>

        <p>Initially, all my aunts and uncles worked in factories, whilst also studying. Eventually everyone got married, except my youngest uncle, who carried on, and eventually worked his way upto a degree. He was the first person in my family to go to University.</p>
