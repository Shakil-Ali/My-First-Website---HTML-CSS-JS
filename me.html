<!-- I have used javascript (jquery ui-widgets) to create an accordian widget - http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ 
I understand that by placing my h3 and p tags within a div lablled with an id called accordian, will allow them to access "accordian" properties. Because I link this page with the jquery ui library, it is able to create this widget. In addition, I have learnt that even if some browsers have not got javascript enabled, they can still view information I am displaying on my wensite.
