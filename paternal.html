<!-- I have used javascript (jquery ui-widgets) to create an accordian widget - http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ 
I understand that by placing my h3 and p tags within a div lablled with an id called accordian, will allow them to access "accordian" properties. Because I link this page with the jquery ui library, it is able to create this widget. In addition, I have learnt that even if some browsers have not got javascript enabled, they can still view information I am displaying on my wensite.

        My paternal family also originates from Sylhet, Bangladesh. My maternal family consists of my grandfather and grandmother. They had 10 children, 7 girls and 3 boys. My dad is the oldest son, as well as the oldest child.

        <p>My grandfather had to work in order to take care of his family. He worked as a farmer. His daily routines included watering and sewing plants, tending to the animals and making sure any ripe vegetables or wheats were harvested, for sale or to eat. As his sons grew older, they also started helping out with farm work. My dad and his younger brother opened a shop, in the local market, and sold vegetables as well as general household items.My grandad was also the  local MP for our village for 15 years. This involved him having to attend meetings. He had to commute quite a lot. One of his annual meetings meant he had to travel to the capital city, Dhaka, which is 6 hours away from Sylhet.

        My grandmother worked as a housewife. She took care of all household chores from washing to cooking. She also helped out in fishing sometimes (fishing was almost everyones hobby). Being the housewife, her main priorities were looking after the children.
